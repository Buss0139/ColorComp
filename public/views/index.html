	   			Assessing new student retention at Omulu Capoeira
	   		</h4>
        <h2>
          Omulu capoeira is a small, but quickly growing martial arts school that needs help retaining new students.
        </h2>
        <p>
        Omulu Capoeira was founded 7 years ago. They have come a long way since their beginning. Their first classes were held in rented rooms on the University of Minnesota campus and today they have their own studio space in Richfield. James Lynch and Jenny Blanchard are hoping to continue to grow their group so that it can become financially self-sustaining.
        </p>
        <p>
        Omulu Capoeira has many people who come to try out a class. They have several avenues of attracting newcomers - from personal referrals, to online deals through Groupon and paper advertising through fliers and local newspapers. The challenge is retaining these new people. Many newcomers try a class or two and do not return. <a>read more</a>
