      <h4>An evaluation of the features and usabiliity of an online medication tracker.</h4>
            <h2>
              Medication compliance is a major issue. It affects patients, health care providers and insurers.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              There are many free, online trackers that claim to make medication tracking easier. However, the complexity of medications, combined with poor user interface makes these trackers less than ideal.
            </h2>

    	   		Heuristic Evaluation and Cognitive Walkthrough

            <p>I evaluated the medication tracking website <a href="mymedschedule.com"> MyMedSchedule.com</a> to  identify any obvious problem areas that I could zero in on later.</p>

              <h4>Potential Problem Areas</h4>

              <h2>There were a number of issues that I identified in the heuristic as potential problem areas.</h2>

              <p>The application only shows the user which step they are on, it doesnâ€™t give the user an overview of how many steps are remaining or what information will be entered at each step. </p>
              <p>The items in the top menu change depending on which section of the application you are using. Additionally, the checklist is not accessible in the top menu.</p>
              <p>The application does not confirm with the user that they have completed their task after saving a medication schedule. </p>

          <h4>Evaluation Testing</h4>

            <div class="row">

              <div class="four columns aligned">
              <p>After completing the heuristic, I created a short "think aloud" usability test to gather more information about the issues with the site.</p>
              <p>The goal of the testing was to evaluate how easily and successfully do users navigate the medication wizard?</p>

              <h4>Major Findings</h4>

              <h2>The tracker did not have sufficient wayfinding, it was hard to tell which step of the process you were in and where you were going next.</h2>

              <h2>Users encountered issues due to confusing labeling.</h2>

              <h2>The text on the site is dense, small and has poor visual hierarchy.</h2>
            </div>
          </div>

            <h4>Website Redesign</h4>

              <div class="row">

                <div class="four columns aligned">
                <p>I created a simple mock up to fix the biggest issues our users experienced - trouble knowing where they were in the application.</p>
                <p>I replaced the buttons at the top of the screen with a graphic showing the user which step they are on in relation to the other steps in the process.</p>
                <p> I made the top level of navigation easier to see and consistent across all pages.</p>
                <p>I also redesigned the "next step" button to be more visible and descriptive.</p>
