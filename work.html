  	   			Assessing new student retention at Omulu Capoeira
  	   		</h4>
            <p>
              Omulu Capoeira was founded 7 years ago. They have come a long way since their beginning. Their first classes were held in rented rooms on the University of Minnesota campus and today they have their own studio space in Richfield. James Lynch and Jenny Blanchard are hoping to continue to grow their group so that it can become financially self-sustaining.

            <p>
            Omulu Capoeira has many people who come to try out a class.
